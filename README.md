Hello Everyone, for this challenge we have the following tests: 

<ul>
  <li>Application must allow a repository to be added to your backend and listed on your frontend within an LI.</li>
  <li>Application must allow that by clicking on the remove button that will be inside the LI of the added repository, the item can be derived from the listing.</li>
</ul>
